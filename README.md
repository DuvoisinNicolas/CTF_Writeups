# CTF_Writeups
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my journey and solutions from various Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions. 

Here, you'll find detailed write-ups that dive into problem-solving processes and the strategies I employ. 

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced CTF participant, I hope these resources inspire and guide your own adventures. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity challenges!

If you aren't there already, you can view the writeups directly on my Github pages: https://gr3ym00n.gitbook.io/ctf-writeups

Enjoy ! :)
